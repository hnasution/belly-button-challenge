# Module 14 Interactive Visualisation 

## belly-button-challenge

### Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) , which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in
the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
